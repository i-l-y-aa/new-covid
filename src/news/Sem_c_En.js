    <div class="row my-4"><p class="lead">Segmentation of lesions in medical images is an important task for the treatment of patients. Neural network approaches have become widespread in solving this problem. However, for their successful development, it is necessary to obtain a high-quality data set with the marking of the affected areas, which is a costly process, since it requires the painstaking work of highly qualified medical professionals. To solve this problem, semi-supervised learning methods are being developed that allow the use of data without markup. This report provides a brief overview of the main ideas underlying these methods.</p></div>
