        <div className="row my-4"><p className="lead">The processes of information dissemination in online social networks can be described by continuous mathematical models, the coefficients of which and the initial data are often unknown or set with a large error, which can lead to an incorrect description of the user's reaction to specific information and incorrect management of this reaction. Therefore, an important step in solving this problem is the analysis and solution of the corresponding inverse problems, which consist in identifying unknown parameters based on additional information about the processes under study. The report will consider the direct and inverse problems of determining the initial condition for a diffusion-logistic model with a nonlinear right-hand side and a medium-field model based on additional information about the process at fixed points in time. The inverse problem is reduced to the problem of minimizing the target functional and is solved by local gradient methods, global particle swarm and tensor optimization methods, as well as combinations of methods using regularization.</p></div>
