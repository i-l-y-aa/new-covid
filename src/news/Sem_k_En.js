        <div className="row my-4"><p className="lead">Statistical data on the dynamics of the epidemic process is a set of time series. Forecasting the spread of an epidemic (extrapolation of a time series) can be described by statistical, differential, agent-based, stochastic, machine learning models and their combinations. However, to manage the epidemic process, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of influence of interacting socio-economic and environmental processes, as well as the dynamics of the epidemic process itself, which is characterized by the parameters of differential, agent-based, stochastic models. Methods of identifiability analysis, optimization, and inverse problems are used to identify the parameters of physically based models. As a result, the controlled parameters of the epidemic process and scenarios of the spread of the disease in the population are evaluated. </p></div>
