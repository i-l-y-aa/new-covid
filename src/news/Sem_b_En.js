    <div class="row my-4"><p class="lead">The spatial epidemiological SIR model is considered, in which people are distributed in a certain populated area and strive not to become infected. To implement the interaction of a large population in the conditions of an epidemic, the approach of medium-field games is used, characterized by the joint solution of systems of partial differential equations of the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman types. For the numerical implementation of mathematical modeling of the spread of an epidemic in a population, taking into account optimal control, a machine learning method is used, namely physically informed neural networks (PINN) with various modifications. The possibility of solving coefficient inverse problems, where information is introduced in the form of additional equations, is considered.</p></div>
